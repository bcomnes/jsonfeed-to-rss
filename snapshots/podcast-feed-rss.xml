      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into what eSports are, its long history, and why it&amp;#8217;s so lucrative. Can you really make a full-time living as a career gamer?

  The first eSports event happened all the way back in the October of 1972 at Stamford University where students competed on the video game Spacewar. The grand prize for the winner was a year long subscription to the Rolling Stones magazine. However, it wasn’t until 1980 whereby the first video game competition was held. The Space Invaders Championship had a great attendance of 10,000 participants and received widespread media attention since Space Invaders (the game of the tournament) was a household name at that point of time.


Duration: 50:43:00
Present: Aaron Stewart, Rich Plumb

      <title>Learn Me Something The Ketogenic Diet</title>
      <link>https://tracking.feedpress.it/link/17115/9328259?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hologramradio</link>
      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into the ketogenic diet, what it is, how it works, and why it&amp;#8217;s been so successful for so many people.

  When you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose and insulin. Glucose is the easiest molecule for your body to convert and use as energy so that it will be chosen over any other energy source. Insulin is produced to process the glucose in your bloodstream by taking it around the body. Since the glucose is being used as a primary energy, your fats are not needed and are therefore stored. Typically on a normal, higher carbohydrate diet, the body will use glucose as the main form of energy. By lowering the intake of carbs, the body is induced into a state known as ketosis.


Duration: 55:57:00
Present: Aaron Stewart, Rich Plumb

      <description>Synopsis: This week on the podcast, Michael is back from vacation to discuss the European Union&amp;#8217;s new data privacy law, GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018. Businesses have had a long time to work on getting compliant, so why is it that some are shutting off access to their EU users and how does this affect the general public? Also, we&amp;#8217;re about a week away from Apple&amp;#8217;s WWDC conference, so this is also our pre-WWDC show where we discuss what we know and what we don&amp;#8217;t.

      <itunes:summary>Synopsis: This week on the podcast, Michael is back from vacation to discuss the European Union&amp;#8217;s new data privacy law, GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018. Businesses have had a long time to work on getting compliant, so why is it that some are shutting off access to their EU users and how does this affect the general public? Also, we&amp;#8217;re about a week away from Apple&amp;#8217;s WWDC conference, so this is also our pre-WWDC show where we discuss what we know and what we don&amp;#8217;t.</itunes:summary>

      <title>Learn Me Something The Tragedy of Alfie Evans</title>
      <link>https://tracking.feedpress.it/link/17115/9196270?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hologramradio</link>
      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich discuss Alfie Evans, an infant boy from Liverpool with an undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder. This was a troubling legal case that drew significant public attention in the United Kingdom and overseas, and we have mixed feelings about.

  The medical team and the child&amp;#8217;s parents disagreed about whether to maintain Evans&amp;#8217; life support or to withdraw it, resulting in a legal battle. Alder Hey Children&amp;#8217;s NHS Foundation Trust sought a declaration that continued ventilatory support was &amp;#8220;unkind and inhumane&amp;#8221;, and not in Evans&amp;#8217; best interests. Alfie&amp;#8217;s parents, Kate James and Thomas Evans, resisted the application. (retrieved from Wikipedia)


Duration: 59:07:00
Present: Aaron Stewart, Rich Plumb

Who was Alfie Evans?
When did Alfie Evans die, who are his parents Tom Evans and Kate James and how old was he when he died at Alder Hey hospital?

      <description>Synopsis: This week on the podcast, an in-depth discussion about Facebook&amp;#8217;s announcement that they&amp;#8217;re getting into the online dating space. It seems like such a tone-deaf response after the Cambridge Analytica fiasco and senate hearings with Mark Zuckerberg about mishandling user data, or is it? Will anyone use the Facebook dating service, does anyone care, and will not jeopardize its competitors businesses?

      <title>The Impromptu Apple Delays Cross-Platform “Marzipan” UI?</title>
      <link>https://tracking.feedpress.it/link/14937/9022248?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hologramradio</link>
      <description>Synopsis: This week on the podcast, Michael and Alex dive deeper into the topic of &amp;#8220;Marzipan,&amp;#8221; the code-named cross-platform UI that supposedly would be announced at WWDC this June (we think it&amp;#8217;s been delayed?). If you haven&amp;#8217;t been keeping up on the reasons why this shift is happening on Apple&amp;#8217;s platforms, what it means for developers and consumers, and why you should care, you might want to listen to our previous podcast where we introduce the topic.

  There is indeed an active cross-platform UI project at Apple for iOS and MacOS. It may have been codenamed “Marzipan” at one point, but if so only in its earliest days. My various little birdies only know of the project under a different name, which hasn’t leaked publicly yet. There are people at Apple who know about this project who first heard the name “Marzipan” when Gurman’s story was published. &amp;#8211; John Gruber

      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into the topic of the NRA, its history and why guns are coveted in America, why reasonable gun control laws haven&amp;#8217;t happened, and pose the question: is the NRA is the real problem?

  There are by various estimates anywhere from 270 million to 310 million guns in the United States—close to one firearm for every man.

      <itunes:summary>Synopsis: Author Shobha Rao discusses her debut novel, GIRLS BURN BRIGHTER, as well as the plight of human trafficking in India, how fiction has changed in a post-9/11 world, the perseverance of the human spirit, whether fiction writers have an obligation to expose the dark truths about humanity, and how she wrote the book in two months while living in complete isolation. Also, apologies for the abrupt ending &amp;#8211; we had a lengthy conversation about my own writing I didn&amp;#8217;t think anyone wanted to sit through and by the end of it, I completely forgot to thank Shobha and ask her the usual &amp;#8220;where can people find you?&amp;#8221; Time flies when you&amp;#8217;re talking shop.</itunes:summary>

      <title>The Impromptu Dark Patterns</title>
      <link>https://tracking.feedpress.it/link/14937/8955952?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hologramradio</link>
      <description>Synopsis: This week on the podcast, Michael and Alex dive deeper into the topic of dark patterns. Dark Patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that make you buy or sign up for things that you didn&amp;#8217;t mean to. Although many companies employee these unsavoury techniques, Facebook has come under fire lately for doing this, which strikes us as odd, especially right after the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.

Duration: 41:29:00
Present: Michael Norton, Alex Knight

Facebook face-recognition error looks awkward ahead of GDPR
Facebook Is Using Dark Patterns To Undermine EU Privacy Rules

      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into the topic of sleep, a follow up to our episode on dreams. How does science define sleep and what are all of the components that make it up? Why are some people unable to get regular restful sleep? There&amp;#8217;s a ton of research that is being done on the subject, so we scratch the surface of that in this podcast to try and figure it all out.

  Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles, and reduced interactions with surroundings.

      <link>https://tracking.feedpress.it/link/14937/8679001?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hologramradio</link>
      <description>Synopsis: What are your limits with what you&amp;#8217;re willing to tolerate as far as data collection on your life is concerned? Do you realize that your political views can be influenced on social media platforms like Facebook? No? Well, you&amp;#8217;d be wrong, because it is. This week on the podcast, we dive into the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook privacy breach, affecting millions of Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm which combines data mining, data brokerage, and data analysis with strategic communication for the electoral process, has been outed as using millions of American&amp;#8217;s data to skew their political views during the 2016 Federal election.
So where was Facebook while this was happening? They were sitting idly by as companies like Cambridge Analytica abused their platform to extort your internet time to support anti-democractic behaviour. Social media and the technologies that power them are constantly evolving, but policy and law continues to fall behind, and the law makers working on creating policy don&amp;#8217;t fully grasp how these platforms operate. How are we to move forward? Has the line finally been crossed where we&amp;#8217;ve had enough? Are we willing to sacrifice what we get out of Facebook by deleting our accounts, or should we wait for governments to put pressure on Facebook to enact serious user data protection change?

Duration: 39:00:00
Present: Michael Norton, Alex Knight

Synopsis: Author Lisa Lueddecke discusses her Young Adult fantasy novel, A SHIVER OF SNOW AND SKY, the origins of its fairy tale-esque story, what draws her to the Young Adult demographic, writing three-dimensional characters, successfully juggling multiple POVs, and the necessity of enthusiastic beta readers.

Criss-crossing Rust Belt mining towns and Filipino rice paddies, Actual Miles finds Warner disassembling home and extracting language from record grooves and Mason jars to reclaim his identity as a bastard son of the highway.

I usually don’t link to books on Amazon because I like to encourage listeners to shop small and purchase from independent bookstores. That said, Lisa’s book isn’t available in the US (yet), so I’ve included both a link to Amazon and a link to Waterstones (UK). If you live outside the United states and are able to purchase ASOSAS from an indie shop, PLEASE DO. Other books mentioned in the episode are linked to Gibson&amp;#8217;s Bookstore, a lovely indie bookshop in Concord, New Hampshire. &amp;#8211; HM

      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into how psilocybin &amp;#8220;magic&amp;#8221; mushrooms work.

Duration: 47:00:00

      <title>Learn Me Something Sexual Assault</title>
      <link>https://tracking.feedpress.it/link/17115/8219917?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedpress.me&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hologramradio</link>
      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into the timely, yet regrettably horrifying topic of sexual assault. Where does it come from? What perpetuates it? When you look at statistics, the number of people who experience sexual assault is staggering, and often times the act is committed by someone close to you. In this episode, Rich and Aaron unpack this seemingly unsurmountable and insidious problem in society.

  How many women are affected? A recent large-scale study surveying 42,000 women found that up to 21% of women in the EU had experienced sexual harassment in the preceding 12 months. Estimates for the UK were higher at 25%. According to the General Social Survey on Canadians’ Safety (Victimization), there were 22 incidents of sexual assault for every 1,000 Canadians aged 15 and older in 2014. This represented approximately 636,000 self-reported incidents of sexual assault. Of every 100 incidents of sexual assault, only 6 are reported to the police.

      <description>Synopsis: This week on the podcast, we&amp;#8217;re here to tell you that the moon is really green and it&amp;#8217;s made of cheese. That&amp;#8217;s right, everything you know about the moon is a lie. No, just kidding. Last year Facebook got a lot of flack for not doing anything to stave off the deluge of Russian propaganda and fake news in general, and now they&amp;#8217;ve finally decided to do something about it. And now YouTube is finally doing something about this too. This week, YouTube announced they&amp;#8217;re going to be making changes, sort of similar to what Facebook is doing, to flag content that could be considered conspiracy theories or propaganda of some kind. Is this a good thing? Most certainly yes, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t fully solve the problem. We get into that discussion and more, including an update on Nintendo Labo. Stay tuned for that, that&amp;#8217;s coming up next on The Impromptu.

      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into the ominous sounding topic of &amp;#8220;The Doomsday Clock.&amp;#8221;

  What is the Doomsday Clock? No, it&amp;#8217;s not the famous song by the British metal band Iron Maiden. The Doomsday Clock is a design that warns the public about how close we are to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making. It is a metaphor, a reminder of the perils we must address if we are to survive on the planet.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> This week on &#8220;Learn Me Something,&#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into the ominous sounding topic of &#8220;The Doomsday Clock.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What is the Doomsday Clock? No, it&#8217;s not the famous song by the British metal band Iron Maiden. The Doomsday Clock is a design that warns the public about how close we are to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making. It is a metaphor, a reminder of the perils we must address if we are to survive on the planet.

      <description>Synopsis: This week on &amp;#8220;Learn Me Something,&amp;#8221; Aaron and Rich delve into what phobias are, how they&amp;#8217;re developed, and the scientific research behind how they can be embedded in our genes. The fact is, many of us have strong, even uncontrollable fear reactions to harmless (or just slightly threatening) things. These reactions are uncomfortable and may even disrupt our lives. These reactions are called phobias.
